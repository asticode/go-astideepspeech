# Warning

[DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) doesn't seem to be maintained anymore by Mozilla. [Coqui](https://github.com/coqui-ai) is one of the projects that continued building on top of this awesome project. Check out the GO bindings for Coqui [here](https://github.com/asticode/go-asticoqui).

# Astideepspeech

Golang bindings for Mozilla's [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) speech-to-text library.

`astideepspeech` is compatible with version `v0.9.0` of `DeepSpeech`.

# Installation
## Install DeepSpeech

- fetch an up-to-date `native_client.<your system>.tar.xz` matching your system from DeepSpeech's ["releases"](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/tag/v0.9.0)
- extract its content to /tmp/deepspeech/lib
- download `deepspeech.h` from https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/raw/v0.9.0/native_client/deepspeech.h
- copy it to /tmp/deepspeech/include
- export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/tmp/deepspeech/lib/"
- export CGO_CXXFLAGS="-I/tmp/deepspeech/include/"
- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/deepspeech/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Alternatively, copy the downloaded `libdeepspeech.so` and `deepspeech.h` files
to directories that are searched by default, e.g. `/usr/local/lib` and
`/usr/local/include`, respectively.
